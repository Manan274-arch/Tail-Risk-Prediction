# Tail Risk–Reward Prediction

This project studies tail risk–reward asymmetry in financial time series using machine learning models.  
The objective is to quantify downside tail risk relative to expected upside returns and evaluate its predictive usefulness.

---

## Problem Statement
Financial returns are asymmetric and heavy-tailed. Traditional risk measures fail to capture extreme downside events.  
This project models conditional tail risk and risk–reward ratios from historical price data.

---

## Approach
- Historical price data and log-returns
- Tail risk metrics (CVaR / Expected Shortfall)
- Feature engineering using rolling statistics
- Machine-learning models for prediction
- Out-of-sample evaluation

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
